safe_script
===========

this scrip  is about providing an easy to use and quick working command
line interface for system updates and optimizations. it is written in shell 
and works only with arch linux. 

the idea is to make backups more comfortable and also to explore nice
shell commands like # pacman -Rcsn `pacman -Qdtq` \ ... 

Usage:

the script will need admin rights !
also make sure its executable by

# chmod +x safe_script.sh

then use by:

# ./safe_script.sh
